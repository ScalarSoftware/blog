I recently spoke at the [Waterloo Technology Chautauqua](https://www.meetup.com/Waterloo-Technology-Chautauqua/){:target="_blank"} Meetup to give an introduction on why infrastructure as code is important and the use-cases for implementing it. I also spoke about my experiences with Infrastructure as code and Terraform at scale.

The code from the talk can be found on [GitHub.](https://github.com/scalarsoftware/terraform-talk){:target="_blank"}
