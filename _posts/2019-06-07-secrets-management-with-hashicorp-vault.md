I recently spoke at the [Waterloo Technology Chautauqua](https://www.meetup.com/Waterloo-Technology-Chautauqua/){:target="_blank"} Meetup to give a talk on modern approaches to secrets management. I also spoke about my personal experiences with managing secrets.

HashiCorp Vault is a great way to automate your secrets management so you can focus on delivering value to your customers.
