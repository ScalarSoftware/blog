One of my favorite aspects of the cloud is leveraging it to improve your team’s productivity. This blog post won’t mention specific cloud providers because they all provide similar benefits.

The goal of this blog post is to arm you with information that you can use when trying to get buy-in for moving to the cloud.

The cloud provides many benefits but I would like to focus on 4 specific points that can help improve developer productivity.

Let’s get started with the 4 different ways the cloud improves productivity.

## 1. Scalability

Scalability is a big selling point when moving to the cloud. When your application is able to dynamically respond to an influx of traffic without manual intervention, your team can spend more time focusing on product development.

Having a strong uptime for your customers will improve the user experience and will make your developers happier when they don’t have to respond to an outage at 3:00 am.

Being able to dynamically scale your application without manual intervention makes everyone’s job easier and makes your application’s user experience better.

Automated scalability allows your team to focus on more important work.

## 2. Availability

Cloud providers offer excellent service level agreements for their customers. Hosting your application on a cloud environment will ensure that your infrastructure will have good uptime. 

Not having to focus on application uptime and availability will allow your team to once again focus more on product development. In the past, maintaining good uptime was difficult. Using a cloud provider makes this easy.

A cloud provider’s job is to focus on infrastructure availability. Your team’s main focus is product development so they usually don’t do as good of a job as the cloud provider when it comes to managing uptime. Cloud providers also have a lot of experience ensuring their service offers high uptime.

## 3. Managed Services

One of my favorite aspects of the cloud is the managed services providers offer. Majority of cloud providers offer managed platforms that are easy to use and set up.

In the past, a lot of tooling required for your application had to be set up and maintained by your team which takes a lot of time and effort.

Not having to set up and maintain a service has a huge upside with little downside. Cloud providers are offering things like managed databases which handles redundancy and updates without human intervention.

## 4. Integration

Being able to easily integrate seamlessly with other cloud tools the provider offers saves your team a lot of time. These easy integrations allow your team to quickly get a workflow set up which took a long time in the past.

Being able to integrate things like logging and monitoring quickly will save your team time in the future and will make them more effective without having to invest too much time.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, there are many different ways you can leverage the cloud to improve your team’s productivity. Scalability, availability, managed services, and integration are 4 of the many different ways you can improve the productivity of your team.

If you aren’t using the cloud today, I would suggest trying to start migrating today in order to get all of the great benefits that come with it.

Migrating to the cloud and leveraging the services the provider offers will improve developer productivity and will allow you to deliver value to customers faster.
