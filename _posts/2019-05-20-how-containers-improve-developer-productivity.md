Containers are a recent trend that has changed the way we run applications. Containers simplify configuration management and make your application portable so you can run it anywhere. Containers have changed the way we do software deployments and environment management.

The goal of this post is to show you how containers are able to improve developer productivity. If you’re suffering from slow release cycles, manual developer onboarding, and environment configuration issues then this blog post is for you.

## Common Issues We Hear

Anyone who has worked on a development team has heard at least 1 of the following statements:

“I’m not sure why it’s not working in staging, it works on my local environment.”

“I’ve been helping the new team member set up their environment all day.”

“The staging environment isn’t up to date so I can’t test this change”

Containers have addressed all 3 of these issues which I will cover below.

## What are the Benefits of using Containers?

Here are the benefits of using containers:

### Consistency

Containers allow you to have consistent environments. Your development, staging, and production environment configuration can be identical.

Because you no longer have to worry about environment configuration, it makes it easier to test changes which enables your team to release changes more often.

Consistent environments also make it easier to onboard new team members. Since environments work the same way, you will be able to onboard new team members much quicker than before.

Having consistency solves a lot of issues your team has around software release cycles and environment configuration.

### Scalability

Containers make it easy to scale your application. If you’re using a container orchestration platform then you get auto-scaling out of the box. The platform will handle the scaling for you if certain thresholds are reached.

When your team doesn’t have to intervene when an application needs to scale, it allows your team to have a stronger focus on product development. Scalability will improve application uptime, lead to a happier and more productive team. It will also improve the customer experience.

### Operational Simplicity

A major benefit to using containers is how simple it is to manage them. Since the container handles the configuration, it will allow you to deploy it anywhere. This means you no longer have to worry about managing packages on the host system.

Since you don’t have to worry about application packages on the host system, all you need to do is keep the system up to date so security issues don’t arise. If you’re using a Platform as a Service then you won’t need to worry about anything.

The operational simplicity of containers decreases how much time your team spends on configuring, managing, and updating systems.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, containers improve development productivity. Containers solve issues around environment configuration, address scalability concerns, and make operations easier.

Since containers solve a lot of problems, they allow developers to focus more on application development and less on operations.

Containers are an easy and simple way to run your application. Your team should consider using them to see if they’re a good fit in your organization.
